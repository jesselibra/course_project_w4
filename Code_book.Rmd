## Code Book


###Data
The data are from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Download here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

### Variables and data created

"x_test", "x_train", "y_test", "y_train", "features", "activityLbs": original data from the zip
     
"dataset": test and train data combined.   

"datasetms": dataset with just mean and standard deviation columns.  
"join": Join adding activity labels to the datasetms    
"datasummary": means by subject, activity, and measure

###Description of run_analysis.R
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names (done in step 1).
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of 
each variable for each activity and each subject.
